Driving a PixelPusher with the BeagleBone
=========================================

This is a story of pushing pixels
from an autonomous BeagleBone black.


Java setup
----------

The PixelPusher library is written in Java.
BeagleBones don't ship with Java,
but this is [easily remedied](http://derekmolloy.ie/running-java-applications-on-the-beaglebone-black/).


TODO
----

1. Get a simple program driving pixels from the BeagleBone.

2. Hook up to one of the analog inputs to the program.


I imported
the [heroicrobotic java code](https://github.com/robot-head/PixelPusher-java)
for controlling a PixelPusher.
